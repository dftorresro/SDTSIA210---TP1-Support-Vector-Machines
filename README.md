# Support Vector Machine (SVM) - Practical Work

## Conceptual Background

This repository contains a comprehensive exploration of Support Vector Machines (SVM), a powerful and versatile machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks but particularly well-suited for classification. Through this project, we delve into the theoretical underpinnings of SVMs, focusing on binary classification, and provide practical examples to illustrate their application.

### Understanding SVM

At its core, SVM is a method that seeks the best decision boundary, which can separate different classes in the feature space with maximum margin. This decision boundary is known as the hyperplane in *SVM* terminology. The instances that are closest to the hyperplane and which directly influence its position and orientation are termed as support vectors.

### Hinge Loss vs. Binary Classification Loss

A pivotal concept in understanding SVM is the notion of Hinge Loss, a key component distinguishing *SVM* from other classification methods. Hinge Loss serves as a differentiable and convex proxy for the non-differentiable 0-1 loss used in binary classification. This makes it particularly suitable for optimization algorithms that require gradient computations. The notebook discusses in detail the advantages of Hinge Loss, including its role in ensuring a global minimum for the optimization problem and its ability to penalize both misclassifications and correct classifications that are too close to the decision boundary.

Certainly! Here's a paragraph on kernels and a section on eigenfaces, both written with a focus on their mathematical foundations. These can be incorporated into your README file to enhance the conceptual background section.

### Kernels in SVM

Kernels play a pivotal role in the functionality of *Support Vector Machines (SVM)*, allowing them to navigate the challenges of non-linear classification problems. Mathematically, a kernel function can be understood as a dot product in a higher-dimensional space without explicitly computing the coordinates in that space, thus avoiding the curse of dimensionality. The essence of kernel trick lies in its ability to transform linearly inseparable data in the original space into a higher-dimensional space where it becomes linearly separable. Common kernels include the Linear Kernel, Polynomial Kernel, Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel, and Sigmoid Kernel. Each kernel has its specific use case, with the choice depending on the nature of the data and the problem at hand. The kernel function essentially measures the similarity or distance between pairs of inputs, thereby facilitating the construction of an optimal separating hyperplane in the transformed feature space.


### Practical Application with Scikit-Learn

The project also includes practical examples of SVM application using the `scikit-learn` library's SVC class. These examples illustrate how to implement linear SVM for binary classification problems, showcasing the algorithm's effectiveness in handling linearly separable data.

## Objectives

This project aims to:

- Provide a clear understanding of SVM and its operational mechanisms.
- Illustrate the advantages of using Hinge Loss in SVM for binary classification tasks.
- Demonstrate the application of SVM using the scikit-learn library.

### Eigenfaces for Dimensionality Reduction (Last implementation)

Eigenfaces refer to a set of eigenvectors used in the computer vision problem of human face recognition. They are derived from the covariance matrix of the probability distribution over the high-dimensional vector space of face images. Mathematically, eigenfaces are computed by performing *Principal Component Analysis (PCA)* on a large set of images, where each image is treated as a point in a very high-dimensional space. *PCA* seeks to find the most significant basis vectors of this space, which correspond to the directions of maximum variance. These vectors (eigenfaces) are then used to project the face images into a lower-dimensional space where faces can be more easily and efficiently compared. The eigenfaces themselves can be visualized as ghostly images representing the principal components of the variance among face images within the dataset. This technique not only helps in reducing the dimensionality of the data, making computational tasks more feasible but also aids in isolating the features that contribute most significantly to the variation in faces.
