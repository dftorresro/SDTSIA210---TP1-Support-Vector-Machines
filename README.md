# Support Vector Machine (SVM) - Practical Work

## Conceptual Background

This repository contains a comprehensive exploration of Support Vector Machines (SVM), a powerful and versatile machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks but particularly well-suited for classification. Through this project, we delve into the theoretical underpinnings of SVMs, focusing on binary classification, and provide practical examples to illustrate their application.

### Understanding SVM

At its core, SVM is a method that seeks the best decision boundary, which can separate different classes in the feature space with maximum margin. This decision boundary is known as the hyperplane in SVM terminology. The instances that are closest to the hyperplane and which directly influence its position and orientation are termed as support vectors.

### Hinge Loss vs. Binary Classification Loss

A pivotal concept in understanding SVM is the notion of Hinge Loss, a key component distinguishing SVM from other classification methods. Hinge Loss serves as a differentiable and convex proxy for the non-differentiable 0-1 loss used in binary classification. This makes it particularly suitable for optimization algorithms that require gradient computations. The notebook discusses in detail the advantages of Hinge Loss, including its role in ensuring a global minimum for the optimization problem and its ability to penalize both misclassifications and correct classifications that are too close to the decision boundary.

### Practical Application with Scikit-Learn

The project also includes practical examples of SVM application using the `scikit-learn` library's SVC class. These examples illustrate how to implement linear SVM for binary classification problems, showcasing the algorithm's effectiveness in handling linearly separable data.

## Objectives

This project aims to:

- Provide a clear understanding of SVM and its operational mechanisms.
- Illustrate the advantages of using Hinge Loss in SVM for binary classification tasks.
- Demonstrate the application of SVM using the scikit-learn library.

## Target Audience

This repository is intended for students, data scientists, and anyone interested in machine learning, providing both a solid theoretical foundation and practical insights into SVM.
